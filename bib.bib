abstract = {An array of periodic surface features were patterned on mesoporous niobium oxide films by a soft-lithographic technique with the goal of constructing a photonic crystal (PC) structure on the back side of the oxide. The oxide films, fabricated by mixing sol-gel derived niobium oxide nanoparticles and hydroxypropyl cellulose, were employed as photoelectrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and their performance evaluated against their flat counterparts. The surface patterns were imprinted using a photocurable perfluoropolyether (PFPE) soft-replica of a silicon master with a two-dimensional array of cylindrical posts (200 nm (D) × 200 nm (H)) in hexagonal geometry. The PC on the niobium oxide surface caused large changes in optical measurements, particularly in the blue wavelengths. To evaluate the optical effect on solar energy conversion, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in the patterned devices and the control group. The IPCE of patterned niobium oxide anodes exhibited a relative enhancement in photocurrent generation over the wavelength range corresponding to the higher absorption in optical measurements.},

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Mott-Schottky analysis and open circuit voltage decay is used to investigate the cause of this improved performance. The enhanced performance is attributed to a combination of increased electron concentration in the semiconductor and a reduced electron recombination rate.},

The inverted solar cells convert photons to electrons at an external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 70\%. This is a 10-15\% increase over EQEs of conventional solar cells. The increase in EQE is not fully explained by the difference in the optical transparency of electrodes, interference effects due to an optical spacer effect of the metal-oxide electrode buffer layers, or variation in charge generation profile. We propose that a large additional splitting of excited states at the ZnO-Al/polymer interface leads to the considerably large photocurrent yield in inverted cells. Our finding provides new insights into the benefits of n-type metal-oxide interlayers in bulk heterojunction solar cells, namely the splitting of excited states and conduction of free electrons simultaneously.},

abstract = {The performance of dye-sensitized solar and photoelectrochemical cells is strongly dependent on the light absorption and electron transfer events at the semiconductor?small molecule interface. These processes as well as photo/electrochemical stability are dictated not only by the properties of the chromophore and metal oxide but also by the structure of the dye molecule, the number of surface binding groups, and their mode of binding to the surface. In this article, we report the photophysical and electrochemical properties of a series of six phosphonate-derivatized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes in aqueous solution and bound to ZrO2 and TiO2 surfaces. A decrease in injection yield and cross surface electron-transfer rate with increased number of diphosphonated ligands was observed. Additional phosphonate groups for surface binding did impart increased electrochemical and photostability. All complexes exhibit similar back-electron-transfer kinetics, suggesting an electron-transfer process rate-limited by electron transport through the interior of TiO2 to the interface. With all results considered, the ruthenium polypyridyl derivatives with one or two 4,4?-(PO3H2)2bpy ligands provide the best balance of electron injection efficiency and stability for application in solar energy conversion devices.

abstract = {The ultrafast photoinduced insulator-metal transition in VO2 is studied at different temperatures and excitation fluences using multi-THz probe pulses. The spectrally resolved midinfrared response allows us to trace separately the dynamics of lattice and electronic degrees of freedom with a time resolution of 40 fs. The critical fluence of the optical pump pulse, which drives the system into a long-lived metallic state, is found to increase with decreasing temperature. Under all measurement conditions, we observe a modulation of the eigenfrequencies of the optical phonon modes induced by their anharmonic coupling to the coherent wave-packet motion of V-V dimers at 6.1 THz. Furthermore, we find a weak quadratic coupling of the electronic response to the coherent dimer oscillation resulting in a modulation of the electronic conductivity at twice the frequency of the wave-packet motion. The findings are discussed in the framework of a qualitative model based on an approximation of local photoexcitation of the vanadium dimers from the insulating state.},

abstract = {In this work, we determine the carrier-transport lengths of electrons and holes (L-e,L-h) for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells using a method applicable to functional devices. By linking the local exciton generation profile [G(x)] in the photoactive layer to photocurrent losses, we are able to determine the onset of bimolecular recombination, which is the dominate loss process of free carrier transport. Even though many factors affect photocurrent generation, we single out bimolecular recombination by measuring the scaling of photocurrent with light intensity as a function of applied voltage. For the common BHJ system, annealed poly-3-hexylthiophene:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), a minimum for L-e in PCBM is found to be 340 nm while L-h is estimated to be 90 nm for P3HT. The relationship between G(x) and carrier transport is further exemplified by demonstrating a scaling exponent below that for traditional space-charge-limited photocurrent. Likewise, by incorporating a drift/diffusion model, an intuitive link between G(x) and charge transport is established where recombination is shown to occur in regions of the photoactive layer far from the electrode of the slowest carrier species. Finally, the consequences of L-e,L-h on device design for operation under 1 Sun conditions are described.},

abstract = {Several perfluoropolyether (PFPE)-based elastomers for high-resolution replica molding applications are explored. The modulus of the elastomeric materials was increased through synthetic and additive approaches while maintaining relatively low surface tension values (<25 mN/m). Using large area (>4 in.(2)) master templates, we experimentally show the relationship between mold resolution and material properties such as modulus and surface tension for materials used in this study. A composite mold approach was used to form flexible molds out of stiff, high modulus materials that allow for replication of sub-20 nm post structures. Sub-100 nm line grating master templates, formed using e-beam lithography, were used to determine the experimental stability of the molding materials. It was observed that as the feature spacing decreased, high modulus PFPE tetramethacrylate (TMA) composite molds were able to effectively replicate the nanograting structures without cracking or tear-out defects that typically occur with high modulus elastomers.},

The photonic crystal geometry is fabricated using a materials-agnostic process called PRINT wherein highly ordered arrays of nanoscale features are readily made in a single processing step over wide areas (approximately 4 cm(2)) that is scalable. We show efficiency improvements of approximately 70\% that result not only from greater absorption, but also from electrical enhancements. The methodology is generally applicable to organic solar cells and the experimental findings reported in our manuscript corroborate theoretical expectations.},

@article{Lopez2002b,
abstract = {The optical properties of VO(2) nanoparticles formed in an amorphous SiO(2) host by stoichiometric ion implantation of vanadium and oxygen and thermal annealing have been determined and correlated with the particle size and morphology. The results show that that the temperature-controlled semiconductor-to-metal phase transition of the VO(2) nanophase precipitates turns on the classical surface plasmon resonance, with specific features that depend on the size and aspect ratio of the VO(2) particles. This effect improves the optical contrast between the metallic and semiconducting states in the near-IR region of the spectrum as a result of dielectric confinement that is due to the SiO(2) host. A fiber-optic application is demonstrated, as is the ability to control the characteristics of the phase transition by using ion implantation to dope the VO(2) nanoparticles with tungsten or titanium ions.},
