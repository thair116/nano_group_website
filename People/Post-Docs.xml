			The application of nanoscale systems in all walks of science has spawned a renewed interest in improvign the resolution limit of optical imaging systems. While optical imaging is by far the fastest method to image features its resolving capabilities are fundamentally limtied by the diffraction limit due to the loss of evanescent waves containing high spatial frequency information. Recently, Pendry showed that a superlens with a negative refractive index retains and amplifies the evanescent waves, creating a perfect, limitless image.
