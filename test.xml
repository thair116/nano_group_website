			Far Field Superlens
		</title>
		<description>
			The application of nanoscale systems in all walks of science has spawned a renewed interest in improvign the resolution limit of optical imaging systems. While optical imaging is by far the fastest method to image features its resolving capabilities are fundamentally limtied by the diffraction limit due to the loss of evanescent waves containing high spatial frequency information. Recently, Pendry showed that a superlens with a negative refractive index retains and amplifies the evanescent waves, creating a perfect, limitless image.

			Photonic Solar Cells
		</title>
		<description>
			Standard photovoltaic devices are fabricated with planar photoactive layers.  This creates a fundamental dilemma, because thinner films are desired for successful free carrier transport, while thicker layers are able to absorb more solar photons.  Currently, we are fabricating, testing, and characterizing photovoltaics with non-planar geometries to boost both absorption and transport properties.  Projects involve both organic and inorganic semiconducting materials. We collaborate closely with Prof. Edward T. Samulski's chemistry group at UNC.

		<description>
			Last week Abay went to the Super Freakin Solar Conference. He presented his paper on bitchin thin but super efficient solar cells that make use of AZO nanoparticles. The paper can be found here and more information on the research project can be found here.
